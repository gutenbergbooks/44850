beginning of last week it was midsummer weather,
and <i>not</i> to have cast off winter clothing
and donned light attire would have been deemed "Midsummer
madness." But by Thursday "<i>on a changé tout

in midwinter! The <i>Daily Telegraph's</i>
weather-clerk observed, that all "this
resulted from a deep depression in Denmark."
It certainly caused deep depression
here; and there must be "something
rotten in the State of Denmark" which
ought to be looked to immediately. Ere

remains silent in the mouth of player and

<h2>WAITING FOR NASRULLA.</h2>

<p class="center">["The original arrangements for <span class="sc">Nasrulla Khan's</span> reception in London
have undergone considerable alteration."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper.</i>]</p>

<p>"Of course we ought to act on precedent." said Wise Man Number
One. "We can't be far out if we do that."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure," replied Number Two of the Series. "When
the <span class="sc">Shah</span> came over we gave him a prize-fight at Buckingham Palace,
and the entertainment subsequently caused much hostile criticism in
Clapham."</p>

<p>"It is to be regretted," sighed the Third, "that the Polytechnic
Institution no longer exists. It would have amused his Highness to
have descended in the diving bell."</p>

<p>"No doubt," put in the initial speaker; "but something of the
same effect might be obtained by conducting <span class="sc">Nasrulla</span> either to the
Museum of Mines in Jermyn Street or the Diploma Gallery at Burlington
House."</p>

<p>"Quite so. And what do you say to the Natural History Museum,
and a special visit in semi-state to the top of the Monument?"</p>

<p>This suggestion was well received. Then a trip to Kew, and a ride
on the Elephant at the Zoo were considered not unfavourably.</p>

<p>"Shall he go to any of the theatres?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"It may be a little dangerous to his morals if he understands
English," seemed to be the popular answer.</p>

<p>Then a visit to a music-hall under the immediate supervision of
the London County Council was proposed.</p>

<p>Then a Wise Man (less sage than the majority of his fellows) proposed
a little "slumming."</p>

<p>"He might visit the East End, and pass a night in a Casual Ward."</p>

<p>Fortunately for the honour of the British Empire the proposal
was negatived without the formality of a division.</p>

<p>"Could he be exhibited at a side show, either at Sydenham, Earl's
Court, or West Kensington?"</p>

<p>Again there was a shout of "No." The visit of the Representative
of the Ameer was not to be made a source of income to the
Imperial, or, if it came to that, any other Exchequer.</p>

<p>"Besides," said the initial speaker, "the British Public does not
care for paying for its raree-show. When we <i>do</i> get hold of a
native, we like to find him on view free, gratis and for nothing."</p>

<p>Then it was agreed that <span class="sc">Nasrulla</span> should appear at the Queen's
Birthday Parade, and other "features" were discussed with
animation.</p>

<p>"But what the <span class="sc">Khan</span> will ultimately do, Sir," murmured an
experienced official at the conclusion of the confab, "only Time can
show&mdash;with the assistance of the Government."</p>

<i>Home Rule for Ireland: or, how the O'Reillys, the Maguires, and

came in and the other went out, &amp;c. &amp;c.?</i> Save us from politics on

<h2>THE POET AND HIS INTERVIEWERS.</h2>

<p>I do not dwell in a back-attic with the windows pasted up with
brown paper, neither do I wallow up to my eyes in a litter of manuscript
with flue on the carpet and dust on all the furniture. If ye, or
the Public, have any such impression, ye are very much mistaken.
I may be a literary person and a prose-poet; but I live quite respectably,
and have everything handsome about me. Come and see!</p>

<p>Ye will find the doorsteps freshly scoured, and the door-handle
brightly polished&mdash;which ye will make a note of after ye have rung
the bell.</p>

<p>A trim parlourmaid&mdash;whom ye will allude to as "a neat-handed
<span class="sc">Phyllis</span>"&mdash;will open the door, and request ye to wipe your dirty
boots upon the doormat in the passage&mdash;which ye are expected to
mention as the "spacious entrance hall."</p>

<p>I shall stand on the threshold of my dining-room, and receive ye
with as much surprise as if the visit were not by previous appointment;
shall accompany ye through all my rooms, and tell ye interesting
facts about the china and the chimney ornaments. I shall
not object to your bringing a camera and taking views of my "cosy
corner" and my hat and umbrella-stand.</p>

<p>They are exactly like those of everybody else, so they are sure to be
pleasing to an art-loving Public.</p>

<p>Ye will find in the drawing-room the perfume of many flowers&mdash;provided
I do not forget to send out for some penny bunches of
violets beforehand&mdash;and ye can take a photograph of the cottage
piano and my pet canary (which usually has its habitation in the
kitchen, as I loathe all birds&mdash;but this is <i>not</i> for publication).</p>

<p>I will show ye the stand of wax-flowers fashioned by my maternal
grandmother&mdash;which will give ye an opportunity of commenting upon
the heredity of genius in my talented family&mdash;and ye may peer into
the silver <i>épergne</i> that was presented to my Uncle at the Cattle Show
for a prize pig. Ye will probably think it necessary to make a copy
of the inscription.</p>

<p>In the study&mdash;to which I shall humorously allude as my "den"&mdash;there
is little of general interest except my old carpet slippers.
Mayhap ye will point to a few pipes that lie on the mantelpiece; but
they are merely "properties," for the public expects all striking
literary personalities to write with pipes in their mouths.</p>

<p>Come to me! I fear ye not. It is ye who confer celebrity. I
know ye so well. I shall follow ye out into the garden, and ye shall
carry stylographs in your waistcoat pockets, and I will relate to ye
my early literary experiences, give ye my theories on the Social
Question, and let ye kodak my child in its perambulator.</p>

<p>I know ye; ye will convey a totally false impression of my views,
which I shall have to write to all the leading journals to correct. Ye
will force me into the publicity and self-advertisement from which
my sensitive soul shrinks. Ye will describe the insides of my rooms,
for the benefit of the buzzing swarm which has hitherto shown no
overwhelming curiosity concerning the insides of my works.</p>

<p>Still, I do not mind your coming, provided that ye give me an
opportunity of revising a proof of the interview. Ye are necessary
nuisances.</p>

<p>Lazily, dreamily, we floated down the pellucid stream, <span class="sc">Aspasia</span>
at the single thwart, I, her loved one,
at the tiller. The last gleaner had
left the fields. Over the grave of
the dead sun I saw the eye of Hesperus,
early and thoughtful. The
words of the Poet Laureate came
back to me; it seemed that "in
yonder Orient star a hundred spirits
whispered</p>

<p>"Peace!" Now the light shallop trembled to the stroke of
ASPASIA'S sculls, and the brawny muscles lifted beneath her flannel
suiting. Myself so frail, I adore the pride and prowess of womanhood,
that moves through the world conquering and to conquer.

<p>At last she pulled herself together with the self-assurance of a

<h2 class="sans">OPERATIC NOTES.</h2>

<p><i>Opening of Opera.</i> <i>Monday, May 13.</i>&mdash;Crowded house. <i>Grand
Otello Co.</i> unlimited. The Orchestra has been sunk four feet, thus
giving Stalls clear view of stage. <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> proposes a puzzler
"Orchestra <i>lowered</i>," he says, "yet all performers in it <i>hired!</i>"
Royal Highnesses present. <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span>, taking happy musical
publishers' points of view, looks towards Royal Box and murmurs
"'Royalties' on music." <span class="sc">Albani</span> surpasses herself as <i>Desdemona:</i>
quite wonder that <i>Otello-Tamagno</i> has the heart to smother her with
pillow after her song about the willow. Signor <span class="sc">Pessina</span> as <i>Iago:</i>
rather a ponderous villain. Pecuniary operatic prospects exceptionally
good: at all events, possessing <span class="sc">Jean de Reszke</span>, <span class="sc">Tamagno</span>, and
<span class="sc">Bertran</span>, <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> has "three tenners" in hand to start
with.</p>

<p class="center">Vocal and Orchestral. Marguerite and Strauss.</p></div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Boïto's</span> <i>Mefistofele</i>. "An opera that 'grows on
you,'"
says <span class="sc">Lounger</span> in the Lobby. "If there were a probability of many
such growing on <i>you</i>, my dear <span class="sc">Lounger</span>," quoth Sir
<span class="sc">Druriolanus</span>,
with satirical affability, "you would be worth cultivating." The
advantage of a long
opera, with disconnected
acts, is,
that you can "pick
'em where you
like," as the coster
says of the walnuts,
and come in
anywhere for
something good.
<span class="sc">Maggie Macintyre</span>
is "getting
a big girl now."
Charming as <i>Margherita</i>
and <i>La belle
Hélène</i>. Signor
<span class="sc">de Lucia</span> a rather
timorous and bashful
<i>Faust</i>, with one
eye for <span class="sc">Maggie</span>
and the other for
<span class="sc">Nelli</span> (short for
<span class="sc">Mancinelli</span>), as if
praying the latter to conduct him safely and keep him from temptation
to go wrong. <i>Faust</i> in situation of <span class="sc">Toole</span> in <i>The
Houseboat</i>,
when he used to exclaim, "<span class="sc">Sarah</span>! I'm slipping!" <span class="sc">Plançon</span>
equally good as <i>Jupiter</i> or <i>Mefistofele</i>; this time it is
<i>Mefisto</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<i>Le Prophète.</i> In spite of name, unprofitable opera.
Signor <span class="sc">Tamagno</span> (or familiarly <span class="sc">Tam Agno</span>), as <i>Jean of
Leyden</i>, rather
over-laden, but bearing burthen bravely. <span class="sc">Tam</span> receives big <i>encore</i>
in
Star-spangled Banner Hymn. The two <span class="sc">Corsis</span> and <span class="sc">Castelmary</span>
ably represent Liberator Firm of <i>Jonas, Zaccaria, Mathisen &amp; Co.</i>,
always ready to draw on their false prophet in order to save their own
credit. Two <span class="sc">Corsis</span> and dessert to follow. Beaming <span class="sc">Bevignani</span>
conducts
invisible orchestra.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Sudden change from summer to winter. Comparatively
thin house. Ladies as wrapperees in furs. Everyone welcoming
<i>Pagliacci, or the Mummers</i>, as pantomime suitable to season.
In spite of this, warm welcome to <i>Pagliacci</i> and to Madame <span class="sc">Fanny
Moody</span> as <i>Nedda</i>. She is quite the character: Moody yet lively.
<span class="sc">Ancona</span> and <span class="sc">De Lucia</span> good and dramatic as ever as <i>Tonio</i>
and
<i>Canio</i>. <i>Début</i> of Miss <span class="sc">Marie Engle</span>, who, whether German or
French, will be a favourite with the Engle-ish, starting uncommonly
well as <i>Little Bo-Peep-Baucis</i>. <i>King Jove-Plançon</i> and
<i>Vulcan-Castelmary</i>,
the limping Olympian, excellent as usual. Everyone
suffering from wintry blasts in stalls envies <i>Vulcan</i> rubbing his
hands and warming himself at <i>Bonnard-Philémon's</i> fire. Such a
night in May is enough to knock any piece to shivers. The conductors
of the operatic 'bus were, for the first journey, Soothing
<span class="sc">Seppilli</span>; and for the second, Beaming <span class="sc">Bevignani</span>.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Still wintry. Italian-German opera <i>Lohengrin</i>, with
Cosmopolitan Caste, going stronger than ever. House full and fully
satisfied. Hard to please if it had not been so, with <span class="sc">Albani</span> as
<i>Elsa</i>,&mdash;(says
<span class="sc">Wagstaff</span>, affecting a drawl, "Nobody else-a can touch her
in this"),&mdash;<i>Jupiter-Plançon</i> as a King, not of gods but men, and
<span class="sc">Bertran</span>, from La Scala, as a <i>First-Knight Lohengrin</i>. As to
intruder
<i>Ortruda</i> and Terrible <i>Telramonda</i>, these heavy weights are
lifted by Mlle. <span class="sc">Olitzka</span> and Signor <span class="sc">Ancona</span>. Monarchical
<span class="sc">Mancinelli</span>
treats Time like a dusty carpet, beating it strongly.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Crowded house to welcome old friend <i>Trovatore</i>.
<span class="sc">Pessina</span> as the wicked nobleman; and <span class="sc">Tamagno</span>&mdash;now known as
"<span class="sc">Tam</span>"&mdash;in splendid voice for the Trovatore himself. "<span class="sc">Tam</span>"
doubly encored after "<i>Di quella pira</i>." <span class="sc">Julia Ravogli</span> not quite
the <i>Azucena</i>. Mlle. <span class="sc">Bauermeister's</span> first appearance this season:
as
heroine's sympathetic companion <span class="sc">Bauermeister</span> combines the
"<i>utile</i>"
with the "<i>dulce</i>." <span class="sc">Maggie Macintyre</span> vocally good, dramatically
puzzling. House happy: <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> delighted. Fine finish to
first week.</p>

<h2>THE PREMIER'S CRUISE.</h2>

<p><i>Portsmouth, Monday.</i>&mdash;Thank heaven! Got rid of politics for a
season. Off to Cowes, as guest of <span class="sc">Spencer</span>, on board <i>Enchantress</i>.
Admirable institution, an Admiralty yacht; reconciles one to Naval
Estimates, almost. But there!&mdash;must <i>not</i> think of Estimates now.
Must try and remember this is a holiday, to get ozone and sleep&mdash;especially
sleep.</p>

<p><i>Cowes.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Spencer</span> really <i>very</i> nautical. Talks of fast
cruisers and
water-tube boilers all the time. Great on torpedo-destroyers. Says
the <i>Havoc</i> "goes twenty-five knots an hour." Well then, why can't
<span class="sc">Harcourt</span> get up the same pace with our Bills? Wish he'd turn
into a Parliamentary <i>Havoc</i>. Mention this to <span class="sc">Spencer</span>, who laughs,
and says, "It's the Opposition who indulge in twenty-five Nots an
hour." Believe <span class="sc">Spencer</span> means it as a joke. Turn in, and think of
<span class="sc">Harcourt</span> and <span class="sc">Spencer's</span> joke and Twin-Screw Cabinets and
Water-veto-boiler
Bills. Wretched night!</p>

<p><i>Portland, Tuesday Morning.</i>&mdash;Rather unfair of <span class="sc">Spencer</span>. Now
he's got me safely on board, he's always trying to persuade me that
Navy wants more money spent on it. More money! Refer him to
<span class="sc">Harcourt</span>, the "inexorable <i>Jorkins</i>." Try to hide from
<span class="sc">Spencer</span>.
No good. He finds me behind a coil of rope on half-quarter-deck&mdash;<i>is</i>
it half-quarter-deck? Not sure, and don't like to ask&mdash;and begins
again. Seems he would like a few more millions for guns. Thought
we had heaps of guns. Talks about a ship he calls <i>The Hecckler</i>.
What a name! Reminds me of every political meeting I've ever
attended. Why will Lords of Admiralty give such names? <span class="sc">Spencer</span>
explains&mdash;seems it's <i>Hecla</i>, not <i>Hecckler</i>. Oh! All right. Fear
<span class="sc">Spencer</span> begins to think me rather a land-lubber. Got me at an
advantage here. Wait till I take him to Newmarket Heath!</p>

<p><i>Off Plymouth.</i>&mdash;Down in engine-room. Tell head stoker that
House of Lords is an effete institution. Stoker winks. <i>Can</i> he be a
Tory? Tell him it's a "gilded prison." Stoker seems surprised,
and asks, "Why I don't chuck it up, then?" Curious&mdash;no repartee
handy. And I am so good at them, generally. Must consult
"<i>Fridoline</i>," <i>traduit de l'Anglais de "Happy Thoughts,"</i> to see
what would be a "repartee to a stoker." Bed. <span class="sc">Spencer</span> won't
hear of it as bed; talks of "turning-in to his bunk." What an
enthusiastic "First Lord" <span class="sc">Spencer</span> does make! Thinking of First
Lord, wonder who'll be Last Lord? Go on wondering till dawn.
What a noise swabbing the deck makes! Wish I were back at the
Durdans!</p>

<p><i>Scilly Islands, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Blue sea, lovely weather. Delightful
to have left all worries, all politics, far behind, and to&mdash;&mdash; Boat
seen approaching from land. Man says he has a telegram for me!
Oh, hang telegrams! Wish I were well out at sea. What can it be
about? Japan? Siam? Chitral? No. Only to tell me result of
Walworth and West Dorset elections! Hem! Seems I <i>am</i> at sea&mdash;politically.
Thoughtless of <span class="sc">Asquith</span> to have wired me on the
subject. <span class="sc">Homer</span> handsomely beaten. Why didn't he stick to his
Iliad? And <span class="sc">Reade</span>&mdash;deserves the Old Bailey for being licked by the
new one! Question now is&mdash;where's our majority? Ask <span class="sc">Spencer</span>.
<span class="sc">Spencer</span> replies it's "as plain as a marlinspike." Says Walworth
lost because not enough money spent on Navy. Assures me Navy
"much more important than Army; in fact, it's the Predominant
Partner." This is <i>too</i> much! Ask <span class="sc">Spencer</span>, as a favour, to maroon
me on some desolate isle&mdash;say Lundy. Won't do it. Bribe a sailor.
Landed at Lizard. Off to town! Next time I want sea air, shall
run down to Clacton on the "Belle."</p>

The "<i>Voces Stellarum</i>" at the Oxford Observatory (otherwise
Music Hall) are well worth hearing. Mr. <span class="sc">Burnett</span> (J. P.) has just
issued a brochure on this Music-Astronomical subject, chiefly remarkable
for a brief essay on "The Pantomimic Art," by <span class="sc">Paul Martinetti</span>,
whose right to speak on such a theme, as an authority,
may be arrived at by any one who sees this most artistic pantomimist
in a short melodramatic piece&mdash;a piece which thoroughly tells its
own tale without words&mdash;now being performed nightly at the Oxford.

play in action, and "the student" could read the words
to himself at home? We recommend the idea to Mr. <span class="sc">Paul

"a piece without words," for Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span>, who now looks

<h2 class="sans">THE SCARLET PARASOL.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>Terrace in front of quaint old country house.</i>
<span class="sc">Viola
Travers</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Muriel Vane</span> <i>on garden-chairs.</i>
<span class="sc">Viola</span> <i>is twenty,
dark-eyed, and animated; she holds a scarlet parasol.</i> <span class="sc">Muriel</span>
<i>is eighteen; she has very fair hair, parted with puritanical
precision; the naïve innocence of her manner is not without a
suggestion of artistic premeditation.</i></p>

<p><i>Muriel</i> (<i>embroidering</i>). It is a marvel to me, <span class="sc">Viola</span>, that
you can ever have a discontented moment in a house so Elizabethan as this.</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> It <i>is</i> lovely, <span class="sc">Muriel</span>; a background for mystery and
romance. And I have no romance. I have everything else; but I
have not a romance.</p>

<p><i>Muriel.</i> You have <span class="sc">Albert</span>.</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> You know that <span class="sc">Albert</span> is not a romance.</p>

<p><i>Muriel.</i> Once&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> Ah, when everyone
opposed our marriage.
I married him for love,
and because he was poor
and "unsuitable." How
could I know that his
uncle would die and leave
him money and a country
house? Everything has
turned out so well! It is
rather hard to have made
"a good match," as they
say, without intending it.
Of course, I never reproach
him.</p>

<p><i>Muriel.</i> No; you have
been very nice about it.</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> <span class="sc">Albert</span> is perfectly
happy, playing at
being a country gentleman.
He was so amazed
to find there were real
ducks and fowls in the
country&mdash;and buttercups!
He tells me everything.
He boasts we tell each
other everything. Oh! I
should <i>so</i> like to have
some little thing to conceal
from him&mdash;some secret, just for fun! Of course I should tell
him all about it afterwards, you know.</p>

<p><i>Muriel.</i> I am sure you would, dear. You have dropped your
handkerchief.</p>
<p class="rindent">(<span class="sc">Muriel</span> <i>picks up handkerchief, book, and paper-knife,

<p><i>Muriel.</i> I think I <i>have</i> been rather unfortunate lately,
<span class="sc">Viola</span>.
No one seems to like me but middle-aged married men&mdash;often, too,
with whiskers!</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> You mean poor Mr. <span class="sc">Averidge</span>? He has been married so
long that he has forgotten all about it. To-night <span class="sc">Claude Mignon</span> is
coming to stay with us. He is the most accomplished idiot in
London. He sings, plays, paints, plays games, flirts&mdash;I think his
flirting, though, has rather gone off. It is getting mechanical. By
the way, have you an ideal, <span class="sc">Muriel</span>? I wonder what is your ideal?</p>

<p><i>Muriel</i> (<i>promptly and cheerfully</i>). A man past his first youth,
who has suffered; with iron-grey hair and weary eyes, who knows
everything about life and could guide me, and would do exactly
what I told him.</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> And <i>mine</i> is a young man of genius, just beginning life,
with the world before him, who would look up to me as an inspiration&mdash;a
guiding star!</p>

<p><i>Muriel.</i> You have dropped your handkerchief again, <span class="sc">Viola</span>. Who
is this coming out?</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> It is only Dr. <span class="sc">Roberts</span>. He has been to see <span class="sc">Jane</span>,
the housemaid. She has been rather ill.</p>

<p><i>Muriel.</i> I suppose she had a housemaid's knee.</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> You are quite wrong. She had writer's cramp, poor thing!</p>

<p class="rindent">[Dr. <span class="sc">Roberts</span> <i>has iron-grey hair and dark eyes. As he joins

be here directly!</p>

<p><i>Muriel.</i> You never told me you had asked him! I suppose you
forgot it&mdash;or remembered it. Doesn't he profess to be even younger
than he is? I mean, when he was four, didn't he say he was three?
I wonder if he'll come down in a sailor-suit.</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> He's quite nineteen. Here are those tiresome <span class="sc">Averidges</span>

<p><i>Editor.</i> We can't find room for everything.</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> Quite so, Sir; still it seems a
pity to slaughter this telegram from the front.</p>

<p><i>Editor.</i> Does it make very much?</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> No, Sir. If you will allow me,
I will run through it. (<i>Reads.</i>) "Yesterday
the Loamshire Regiment, headed by its Commander,
Colonel <span class="sc">Snooks</span>, made one of the
gallantest charges on record."</p>

<p><i>Editor.</i> Sure it was <span class="sc">Snooks</span>?</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> Oh yes. We verified it in the
<i>Army List</i>. <span class="sc">Snooks</span> went out with the Second
Battalion when they were ordered to the front.
(<i>Continues reading.</i>) "The soldiers dashed
forward over the Tam-Tam river, and up the
steep sides of the Yah-Yah mountains, carrying
all before them."</p>

<p><i>Editor.</i> Sure of those names?</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> Yes, Sir; verified them on the
map. (<i>Resumes reading.</i>) "Nothing could
withstand the rain of lead and the row of steel.
The Chutnese attempted to use their 'pungarees'&mdash;a
rude sort of pruning knife&mdash;but without
the slightest effect. Uttering their weird
yells of 'Tomata, tomata,' and beating their
drum-like vessels known over here as 'bang-wangs,'
they faltered, floundered and fled."</p>

<p><i>Editor.</i> Sure that those names are correct?</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> Quite, Sir. We verified the
local colouring with <span class="sc">Moke's</span> <i>Six Months in
Chutney on the top of a Camel</i>.</p>

<p><i>Editor.</i> Very good. Is there much more?</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> About a third of a column, describing
the taking of the native village, the
storming of the stockade, and the bivouac by
moonlight after the victory at Pennavilla.</p>

<p><i>Editor</i> (<i>after consideration</i>). Well, it might
give us an effective line for the bill. (<i>A whistle
is heard:</i> Editor <i>listens at a speaking-tube.</i>)
Afraid we must sacrifice it. Manager tells
me there is another rush of advertisements,
so space is more precious than ever. You had
better boil it down into a three-line paragraph.</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> No need to do that, Sir. If
there's a scarcity of room we had better give
the original telegram.</p>

<p><i>Editor.</i> The original telegram?</p>

<p><i>Chief Sub.</i> Yes, Sir; from which we have

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title1">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 13.</i>&mdash;"Well," said the Member
for the Otley division of Yorkshire, "I suppose I've gone
through as many vicissitudes as most men. First I was a <span class="sc">Barran</span>,
now I'm a baronite. Really, I don't know but what, if they'd made
me an earl, I wouldn't go and sit in the House of Lords. Not
because, as good Radical, I don't despise them, but just to give
them advantage of my company, and place in their way a useful
example. Instead of which, here's <span class="sc">Wolmer</span> become Earl of
<span class="sc">Selborne</span>, and insists upon continuing to sit with us!"</p>

<p class="center">The Pirate's Convoy. Penny plain, Twopence coloured.</p></div>

<p>Incursion of the Pirate Peer effectively managed. Those old
campaigners, <span class="sc">George Curzon</span> and <span class="sc">St. John Brodrick</span>, took the
business in hand. The thing was to be a great surprise. Accordingly,
took the <span class="sc">Speaker</span> into confidence, also the <span class="sc">Squire of
Malwood</span> (The Little Minister, <span class="sc">Macfarlane</span>, who has just been
reading <span class="sc">Barrie</span>, calls him), <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, <span class="sc">Joseph</span>,
and a score or
two others. The Pirate Peer was to come down in hansom at
four o'clock, to be met by <span class="sc">Brodrick</span> in Palace Yard; <span class="sc">Curzon</span>,
armed
to the teeth, standing at fifty paces nearer entrance to House of
Commons.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodrick</span>, who likes to do the thing thoroughly, suggested that
the Pirate Peer should fly a black flag out of port-hole at top of cab.
<span class="sc">Curzon</span> liked idea, but thought it would attract inconvenient attention.
Finally compromised by arrangement that cabby should tie
bit of black ribbon on his whip. Effect symbolic without being
obtrusive.</p>

<p>Everything went off excellently. Not a hitch in the arrangements.
Whilst questions still going on <span class="sc">George Curzon</span>, with frock-coat
lightly but firmly buttoned over a belt teeming with pistols, sauntered
in from lobby. Glanced carelessly round House. Accidentally,
as it were, placed himself between unsuspecting Sergeant-at-Arms
and glass door giving entrance to House. If the armed official
attacked Pirate Peer it should be across his (<span class="sc">Curzon's</span>) body.</p>

<p>At preconcerted signal <span class="sc">Brodrick</span> rapidly entered; bustled down
to Front Opposition Bench. Attention of Members thus attracted,
the Pirate Peer followed, strode with firm step down House.
"Just as if he were walking the plank," said <span class="sc">Donald Currie</span>,
looking on admiringly. Before House knew what had happened,
there he sat, smiling and blushing, between those pillars of Law
and Order, <span class="sc">Joe</span> and <span class="sc">Courtney</span>. Never since Parliaments began
had British Constitution received such a staggering blow. <span class="sc">Sage
of Queen Anne's Gate</span>, whilst anxious to see destruction of House
of Lords, is not disposed to have stray fragments incorporated
with fabric of Commons. Called <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> attention to presence in
their midst of the Pirate Peer. Asked what they were going to do
with him?</p>

<p>An anxious moment. <span class="sc">George Curzon</span> tugged nervously at the
arsenal scarcely concealed under his frock coat. <span class="sc">St. John Brodrick</span>
involuntarily stretched forth his hand in direction of Mace.
Suppose he were to seize it, sweep the Treasury Bench clear at a
blow, whilst <span class="sc">George Curzon</span>, with pistol in either hand, and
dagger between his teeth, let fly a volley or two? We might have
had a revolution. Quieter counsels prevailed. <span class="sc">Speaker</span> directed
Pirate Peer to withdraw below Bar whilst his case was being
discussed.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Selborne</span> obeyed the mandate, and the ground thus left clear,
<span class="sc">Joe</span> and the <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> had a tussle. <span class="sc">Joseph</span>
accused the
<span class="sc">Squire</span> of acting in a fit of temper. The <span class="sc">Squire</span> retorted that
it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span>
not only untrue, but that at the time of offering remark <span class="sc">Joseph</span> was
perfectly well acquainted with its entire freedom from the trammels
of truth.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Pirate Peer, looking round uneasily. "I hope
they don't talk like that in the House of Lords."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Clause I. Welsh Disestablishment Bill through
Committee.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Pirate Peer in the offing again. Ran in, as before,
under protection of guns of consorts, <span class="sc">George Curzon</span> and <span class="sc">St. John
Brodrick</span>. Lay to under gallery
whilst question discussed at large.
House never able to keep up interest
in this kind of thing over successive
days. Novel and exciting enough
yesterday; steam not to be got up
for second day. Only for <span class="sc">Joe</span>, business
would have come to conclusion
after formal proposal by <span class="sc">Squire Of
Malwood</span> to refer whole matter to
Select Committee. <span class="sc">Joseph's</span> interposition
led to inevitable row. Wanted,
for some inexplicable reason, to drag
in <span class="sc">Carmichael</span>. Quoted <i>Debrett</i> to
establish his claim to dormant Earldom
of Hyndford.</p>

<p class="center">Evidently a Dormant Duke!<br />
(Mr. Kn-tchb-ll-H-g-ss-n.)</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Joe</span> left alone in advocacy of this
line. <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> had rare
good time. Read passage from <span class="sc">Joe's</span>
speech of last year, when question
to succession of Coleridge Barony
under discussion. Had said then
exactly the reverse of what he to-day
averred in respect of succession
to Selborne Peerage, and status of
new Peer in House of Commons.</p>

<p>"The fatal thing about <span class="sc">Joseph</span>,"
said <span class="sc">Sark</span>, "is that when he makes
a statement on one side of a case or
the other, he does it with such point,
in such felicitous phrase, with such
convincing emphasis, that it sticks
in the memory. When, twelve
months or nine years later, circumstances
lead him to other side of
question, he delivers himself on it
with same incomparable gifts of point and lucidity. The bringing
out of his former assertion is not so conclusive as you would think,
because the two&mdash;affirming a thing is white one day, protesting on
the next it is black&mdash;are so evenly balanced that the case stands
exactly where it did. This sharp confronting of <span class="sc">Joseph</span> denying
with <span class="sc">Joseph</span> affirming would be fatal to some men. To our <span class="sc">Joe</span>
it is
not even embarrassing. House roars with delight. He sits silent,
apparently unconcerned, and somebody else will suffer by-and-by."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Committee appointed to inquire into case of the
Pirate Peer.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;The longer Major <span class="sc">Rasch</span> lives, the fainter grows his
faith in the nobility of human nature. To-night brought down with
him a few carefully selected, choice specimens of the American pea-bug.
Naturally expected everybody would welcome the little stranger.
Especially interesting to Minister of
Agriculture. Being a man of taste,
Major had installed the insects in
dainty <i>bon-bon</i> box; swung it lightly
between forefinger and thumb as he
inquired what <span class="sc">Herbert Gardner</span>
meant to do about it? "Will the
right hon. gentleman," he said,
"have consignments of peas coming
from America marked as such, and
put in bond, so that the bugs may
develop there, and not in the British
market garden?"</p>

<p>At this way of putting it, <span class="sc">Squire
Of Malwood</span> pricked up his ears.
To quick instincts of <span class="sc">Chancellor
of the Exchequer</span> bugs in bond
suggested new field of taxation.
Made a note of it.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Grand Young Gardner</span>
smiled at the claims of long descent
put forward by <span class="sc">Rasch</span> on behalf of
the tenants of his <i>bon-bon</i> box.
"Nothing new in it," he said superciliously.
"Known the creature all
my official life. Your so-called
American pea-bug is nothing more
than the pea and bean weevil. Came
over with the Conqueror. Agricultural
Department even now publishing
leaflet describing manners
and customs of the early settler,
and suggesting various ways of
soothing its last moments."</p>

<p class="center">"I may have been Rash."</p></div>

<p>This hard; sorer still conduct of
Members immediately near the Major. Began to sheer off, putting
him, so to speak, in quarantine.</p>

<p>"I don't care," said <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>, "whether its American pea-bugs
or the pea and bean weevil. What I do say is that no man has any
business to bring such things with him into the social circle."</p>

<p>"I may have been Rash," said the Major humbly.</p>

<p>"You are," said <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> tartly.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Coolness sprung up between <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> and Major
<span class="sc">Rasch</span>. Budget Bill read second time.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;"Pity the sorrows of the poor postman, whose wandering
steps has brought him to your door." Thus <span class="sc">Kearley</span>, in a long
speech, from which it appeared that if there is a down-trodden
fellow-creature whose state looks hopeless, it is the postman. The
story of the man in Wales who trudged seventy miles a day, including
the diurnal ascent of a mountain 7,000 feet high, sent thrill of
horror through House. <span class="sc">Kearley</span> subsequently explained he meant
700 feet high. But that a detail. Seven seems to be this man's
fateful number, for his pay is seven shillings a week&mdash;a shilling a
day, including the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arnold Morley</span>, on other hand, showed that the lot of the postman
is truly idyllic. Handsomely paid when on duty; booted and
uninformed; is accustomed to retire in the prime of life on pension
amounting to two-thirds of his salary.</p>

<p>"Why," said <span class="sc">Willie Redmond</span>, thinking regretfully of days
that are no more, when <span class="sc">Joseph Gillis</span> carried the bag, "as things
go now, it's better to be a postman than an Irish Member." Finally
decided to appoint Committee to inquire into truth of these conflicting
statements.</p>
